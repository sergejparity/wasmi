/// This has two phases:
///
/// 1. `init`:
///     The initialization phase registers all function inputs
///     and local variables during parsing. After parsing all
///     function inputs and local variables the `alloc` phase
///     is started.
/// 2. `alloc`:
///     The allocation phase drives the allocation of dynamically
///     used registers. These are registers that are not function
///     inputs or registered local variables that are implicitely
///     used during instruction execution, for example to hold
///     and accumulate computation results temporarily.
/// 3. `defrag`:
///     The allocation phase has finished and the register allocator
///     can now defragment allocated register space to form a consecutive
///     block of registers in use by the function.
///
/// The stack of registers is always ordered in this way:
///
/// | `inputs` | `locals` | `dynamics` | `storage` |
///
/// Where
///
/// - `inputs`: function inputs
/// - `locals`: function local variables
/// - `dynamics:` dynamically allocated registers
/// - `storage:` registers holding state for later use
///
/// The dynamically allocated registers grow upwards
/// starting with the lowest index possible whereas the
/// storage registers are growing downwards starting with
/// the largest index (`u16::MAX`).
/// If both meet we officially ran out of registers to allocate.
///
/// After allocation the storage registers are normalized and
/// simply appended to the dynamically registers to form a
/// consecutive block of registers for the function.
